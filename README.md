# PureScript Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to get attendees started with practical web app development using PureScript. The focus is on application of PureScript concepts over theoretical understanding.

## Pre-requisites
No prior PureScript knowledge is required. Some familiarity with JavaScript (or at least JavaScript tooling) is helpful.

## Initial setup

[See the README for Exercise 1 for the initial setup.](exercise1)

## Outline

The practical task of the workshop is to build a Hacker News Reader app. This is a front-end web application for reading links and comments from Hacker News.

There are a number of exercises to complete, in sequence, to build up a Hacker news reader. Each exercise is preceded by a short presentation of related PureScript language concepts and the project setup and followed by a presentation of the solution. Each exercise contains the solution to the previous exercise, plus in some cases a small amount of setup for the next exercise.

  * PureScript package documentation
  * Recommendation: add a keyword search for Pursuit so that you can type e.g. `pu Maybe` to search Pursuit for `Maybe`.
* [Pux library documentation](http://purescript-pux.org/)
  * Pux is the UI library used in this workshop.
  * The documentation is concise and informative and helps to understand the UI flow.
