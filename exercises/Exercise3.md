## Exercise 3: Time and the Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

Run the following command from the `exercises` directory to compile and run the exercise. This will also re-compile the code and re-run the exercise when the code changes.

```
npm run exercise3
```

This should compile successfully and display one failing test in [test/Exercise3.purs](test/Exercise3.purs). Open that file in your editor and write code to make that test pass.

There are other tests or test suites within the same file prefixed by `skip`, as in `skipTest` and `skipSuite`. Once the first test has been passed, remove the `skip` portion from the next test, watch the test fail, and then write the code to make that pass, too. Repeat until you run out of tests.

When you are ready, you can move on to [Exercise 4](Exercise4.md).
