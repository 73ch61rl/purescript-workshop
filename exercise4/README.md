# Exercise #4: Generic type classes

## Task

It turns out you don't need to write type classes instances by hand in some cases.
* Rewrite the `Show` instances in the previous exercise to use `Generic` deriving based on [the examples here](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-generics-rep/blob/master/test/Main.purs).

Useful packages: `purescript-generics-rep`

## Topics
* Generic deriving
